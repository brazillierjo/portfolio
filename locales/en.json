    "phrase3": "üçÄ As a SEO specialist, working closely with developers sparked my interest in this highly technical field.

Following that, I continued my learning journey through an apprenticeship program, pursuing a degree in Web and Mobile Applications Integration/Development with a specialization in React and Node.js.",
    "phrase4": "üçæ Since then, I have worked with several companies on complete integrations, provided assistance to deliver projects on time, made modifications, and added new features...",
    "phrase5": "üë∑ Today, drawing strength from my journey, I master the intricacies of the Agile methodology, the principles of Clean Code, and CI/CD pipelines, ensuring optimal scalability and maintainability for each web application I develop.
