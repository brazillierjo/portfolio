      "description": "After a Technical Baccalaureate and a few small jobs, I went back to school at 21 for a degree in e-commerce. This led me to work for 6 years in SEO, where I learned how the professional world works, teamwork, and natural referencing management. Working closely with developers made me want to dive into the technical world. I enrolled in a 6-month bootcamp, then continued with a Web and Mobile Application Developer degree in a work-study program, specializing in React and Node.js. Since then, I've joined several companies for complete integrations, delivering projects on time and adding features. Today, I master Agile methodology, Clean Code principles and CI/CD pipelines. Web Developer since 2020, I particularly enjoy working with Nuxt & Next.js to transform mockups into dynamic and interactive websites.",
