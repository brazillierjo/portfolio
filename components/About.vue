        üìö I initially stopped studying after completing a Technological Baccalaureate. From odd jobs to odd jobs, I
        quickly realized that this context would not be enough for me. So, at the age of 21, I decided to resume my
        studies and pursue a degree in e-commerce.

      <p class="text-justify xl:text-text">
        üèãÔ∏è These studies allowed me to work as an SEO specialist for 6 years. This experience taught me about the
        functioning of the professional world, teamwork, the weight of responsibilities, as well as managing a back
        office and search engine optimization.

        üçÄ As a SEO specialist, working closely with developers sparked my interest in this highly technical field.
        Therefore, I enrolled in a 6-month bootcamp training program to acquire the fundamentals of web programming and
        coding. Following that, I continued my learning journey through an apprenticeship program, pursuing a degree in
        Web and Mobile Applications Integration/Development with a specialization in React and Node.js.

      <p class="text-justify xl:text-text">
        üçæ Since then, I have worked with several companies on complete integrations, provided assistance to deliver
        projects on time, made modifications, and added new features...

        üë∑ Today, drawing strength from my journey, I master the intricacies of the Agile methodology, the principles of
        Clean Code, and CI/CD pipelines, ensuring optimal scalability and maintainability for each web application I
        develop. My diverse experience, spanning from SEO to programming, enables me to bring a unique perspective to
        every project.
